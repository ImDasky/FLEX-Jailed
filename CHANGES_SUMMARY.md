# FLEX Dylib Injection - Changes Summary

## Overview

FLEX has been successfully modified to support injection as a dynamic library (dylib) for debugging iOS apps on **non-jailbroken devices**. When injected, FLEX automatically initializes and displays its debugging interface without requiring any code changes to the target app.

## Files Created

### 1. `Classes/FLEXDylibEntry.m`
- **Purpose**: Entry point that auto-initializes FLEX when the dylib is loaded
- **Key Features**:
  - Uses `__attribute__((constructor))` to run automatically on dylib load
  - Ensures initialization happens on the main thread
  - Waits 0.5 seconds for app initialization before showing FLEX
  - Includes error handling and logging

### 2. `DYLIB_INJECTION.md`
- **Purpose**: Comprehensive guide for building and injecting FLEX
- **Contents**:
  - Step-by-step build instructions
  - Xcode project configuration
  - Code signing requirements
  - Injection methods (Frida, etc.)
  - Troubleshooting guide

### 3. `QUICKSTART_DYLIB.md`
- **Purpose**: Quick reference for experienced users
- **Contents**: Condensed build and injection steps

### 4. `build_dylib.sh`
- **Purpose**: Helper script with build instructions
- **Features**: Color-coded output, step-by-step guidance

### 5. `entitlements.plist`
- **Purpose**: Code signing entitlements template
- **Contents**: Required entitlements for dylib injection on non-jailbroken devices

## How It Works

1. **Dylib Load**: When the dylib is injected into an app, the constructor function `FLEXDylibInit()` runs automatically
2. **Thread Safety**: The constructor checks if it's on the main thread; if not, it dispatches to the main queue
3. **Delayed Initialization**: Waits 0.5 seconds to allow the app to fully initialize
4. **Auto-Show**: Calls `[[FLEXManager sharedManager] showExplorer]` to display FLEX automatically
5. **Error Handling**: Wraps initialization in try-catch to prevent crashes

## Compatibility

### ✅ Works On
- Non-jailbroken iOS devices (with Developer Mode)
- iOS 9.0 and later
- All FLEX features (except some advanced system log hooks)

### ⚠️ Limitations
- Requires proper code signing with Apple Developer certificate
- Requires Developer Mode enabled (iOS 16+)
- Some apps may detect and prevent dylib injection
- System log hooks that require Substrate won't work (but won't crash)

### 🔒 Security Notes
- The existing Substrate dependency in `FLEXSystemLogViewController.m` is optional
- It gracefully falls back if Substrate is not available
- No jailbreak-specific code was added; only non-jailbreak compatible code

## Next Steps

To use this:

1. **Build the dylib** (see `DYLIB_INJECTION.md` or `QUICKSTART_DYLIB.md`)
2. **Code sign** the dylib with your Apple Developer certificate
3. **Inject** using Frida or another injection tool
4. **Debug** - FLEX will appear automatically!

## Testing

The dylib entry point has been created and should work when:
- Properly built as a dynamic library
- Code signed correctly
- Injected into an app using Frida or similar tool

To test:
1. Build the dylib following the instructions
2. Inject into a test app
3. Verify FLEX appears automatically
4. Test all FLEX features to ensure compatibility

## Technical Details

- **Constructor Priority**: Uses default constructor priority (runs after all +load methods)
- **Thread Safety**: Properly handles both main thread and background thread injection
- **Error Handling**: Catches exceptions to prevent app crashes
- **Logging**: Logs success/failure for debugging injection issues

## Notes

- This modification does not break existing FLEX functionality
- The dylib entry point is only active when built as a dylib
- Regular FLEX integration (CocoaPods, manual, etc.) is unaffected
- All existing FLEX features work when injected as a dylib
